# Eclipse IDE Kicks Butt #
> Compared to Microsoft Visual Developer it really kicks Butt!

# Here's Why #
  1. foward to method,field,class with control-click
  1. method list (outline) sync up with current view
  1. current text highlights on error
  1. control space on method('cnt-space' will fill in the methods vars. Huge advantage!
  1. library auto import or select auto import.
  1. svn access
  1. metrics on code
  1. console output
  1. marks problems on the fly!!!! matching var types, matching object types, correct class def. ...
  1. better code formating for cli with brakets {}
  1. jvm jit faster
  1. hierarchy method syncronization
  1. debugging - variables view sync with source code window, breaks easier to manage
  1. windowing windows,views,widgets better
  1. you can use any Database
  1. bugzilla task integration, this is really cool!
  1. Control Up + mouse wheel pages quickly - scroll quickly through code
  1. auto suggestion to fixing, like a object type rename objecta ob = getObjectB();
  1. Marking //TODO tasktodo is great. marks a link on the right side too.
  1. when entering in "string (hit enter)" it will concat the string onto the next line. it will auto add " + at the end of the line and start qoutes on next.
  1. when highlighting parentheses across strings {(}((( )))){)}. it highlights the parentheses across strings like var += "{(}(("; var += ")){)}"; This is really cool in mysql query building.

# Other Things Related #

## Mysql JDBC advantages ##
  1. JDBC row index set, move anywhere in the recordset, can't do this with ms sql jdbc
  1. start,limit query
  1. can't move to last record in recordset, to count how big the recordset is, have to loop the entire set in ms sql logic
  1. Insert,Update syntax can be the same. insert into t set a=1, b=2, update t set a=1, b=2

## Mysql advantages ##
  1. (field = '') = null or nothing and MS you have to go (field is null)
  1. (field != '') and not <> cli context

## Microsoft Visual Developer C# disadvantages ##
  1. get record that is null throws an error insteading of returning null for the variable, have to try catch all gets annoying
  1. object rename,  doesn't understand naming conflicts
  1. object hightlight, won't highlight all objects of the same type on selection.
  1. object reference, often crashes.


## MS Visual Developer diss ##
  1. pauses between pages, takes long time to parse color highlighting
  1. hitting space after var constantly fills in random vars if the abrevation matches, not good in most cases!
  1. no console output for C# code
  1. dataexplorer, can't double click on a table
  1. your stuck with ms sql, couldn't do mysql
  1. You can only inherit one class. You can not extend more than one. You can't implement another class.
  1. notation comments are ugly for methods. I don't like /// it look bad.
  1. no bugzilla integration for multi-developer/community involvment.
  1. Can't control + mouse wheel to page quicly(scroll) through code
  1. cntrl+shift+end goes to end of page, not end of line
  1. highlighting text when selecting across 70+ characters, when it extends the screen is not gradual. The scroll jumps way to far at a time. .5 screen width. auto screen scrolling during selection sucks.
  1. javascript find function won't follow hierarchy.
  1. code formating, doesn't work, with if exp {} spacing sucks.
  1. no auto concat when enter withing quoted string. refer to eclipse #20
  1. No line breaks unchecking global edit, like a list of all the line breaks in one spot. Eclipse has this

## Most annoying thing about coding with Windows ##
  * Focus on window with mouse wheel scroll. - You have to click on window to focus to scroll, not in linux. Linux wheel scroll Much better!!!!!!!!
