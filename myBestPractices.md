# About My Best Practices #
Stuff I like to do to get the job done

## Data Transport ##
  * Listing data in rows - for instance employee
> - employees main object - contains
    * employee types[.md](.md) objects
    * employee[.md](.md) objects

## Widget States ##
  * containing widget states in methods

## Use Null ##
  * use null instead of empty

## Use Setters and Getters in Objects ##
  * use of setters and getters makes for better use of null qualifications

## Value storage in JDO Use of the Object format ##
  * use Long instead of long when storing of object so -1,0,1 and NULL
  * use Integer instead of int so -1,0,1 and NULL
  * use long for ids not Long

## Panel Names ##
  * main widget pWidget - this is my favorite, makes it easy when hitting control space
  * other panels pPanel, fpList, pList, hpList

## Button names ##
  * bMyButton easy for control space in eclipse

## Clear Namespace ##
  * use self descriptive namespace on packages, classes, methods, and parameters/fields etc.
  * use gives longterm ability to reverse engineer own code
  * use gives short timespan to digest pattern when beginning on code
  * exception to that in the method after the defined object, short abbreviations are nice, as long as its clear.

## Comment Everything!!!!!!! ##
  * This is best for short stents in weekend program due to the digestion of the pattern
  * exception to the namespace of self descriptive methods...
  * documenting gives ease of transition to multi-developer development
  * red tape is a pain, but given, I have gone over my own code enough times to regret it
