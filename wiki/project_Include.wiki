= Including Two Projects/Modules Together =
 Including Two GWT Projects/Modules together, so you can reuse code is not to hard. But it can be frustrating at first. 

== What To Do ==
 This is how I do it.
 # Build two projects independently, be sure the stand on there own and run.
 # Be sure both projects have different servlet context for there rpc calls, in RpcService.java and ./war/WEB-INF/web.xml
 # In the project.xml file, inherit the other project, then go to build path and add the project to the build path. Another way is to link the source to its path.
