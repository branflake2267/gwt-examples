= About My Best Practices =
Stuff I like to do to get the job done

== Data Transport ==
 * Listing data in rows - for instance employee
 - employees main object - contains
  * employee types[] objects
  * employee[] objects

== Widget States ==
 * containing widget states in methods

== Use Null ==
 * use null instead of empty

== Use Setters and Getters in Objects ==
 * use of setters and getters makes for better use of null qualifications

== Value storage in JDO Use of the Object format ==
 * use Long instead of long when storing of object so -1,0,1 and NULL 
 * use Integer instead of int so -1,0,1 and NULL
 * use long for ids not Long 

== Panel Names ==
 * main widget pWidget - this is my favorite, makes it easy when hitting control space
 * other panels pPanel, fpList, pList, hpList

== Button names ==
 * bMyButton easy for control space in eclipse

== Clear Namespace ==
 * use self descriptive namespace on packages, classes, methods, and parameters/fields etc.
 * use gives longterm ability to reverse engineer own code
 * use gives short timespan to digest pattern when beginning on code
 * exception to that in the method after the defined object, short abbreviations are nice, as long as its clear.

== Comment Everything!!!!!!! ==
 * This is best for short stents in weekend program due to the digestion of the pattern
 * exception to the namespace of self descriptive methods...
 * documenting gives ease of transition to multi-developer development
 * red tape is a pain, but given, I have gone over my own code enough times to regret it
